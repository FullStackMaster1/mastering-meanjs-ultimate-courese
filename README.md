# ProductMart

Welcome to `product mart` this is an Angular App where we are using Angular Material to develop pages and we are making this app from the scratch to learn angular.

This course is introduction to `MEAN` stack step by step.

- [x] M = MONGO DB
- [x] E = EXPRESS 
- [x] A = ANGULAR
- [x] N = NODE.JS

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
